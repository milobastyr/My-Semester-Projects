#Dog breeds
This Python program helps users find dog breeds based on their preferred size (tiny, small, medium, or large). 
It uses predefined lists of dog breeds and their average weights to filter and recommend appropriate breeds. 
However, there are some logic and formatting issues—like a bug in the "medium" condition and inconsistent capitalization—that could affect its accuracy.









#slot machine
This is a simple slot machine game written in Python. 
It randomly selects five symbols and checks for winning combinations like a "Jackpot" (all 7s), identical symbols, 
or partial matches, awarding points accordingly. 
The player starts with 100 credits and continues betting until they run out or choose to stop.
